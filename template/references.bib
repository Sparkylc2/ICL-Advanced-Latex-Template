    abstract = {Ludwig Prandtl (1875–1953) has been called the father of modern
                aerodynamics. His name is associated most famously with the
                boundary layer concept, but also with several other topics in
                20th-century fluid mechanics, particularly turbulence (Prandtl's
                mixing length). Among his disciples are pioneers of modern fluid
                mechanics like Heinrich Blasius, Theodore von Kármán, and Walter
                Tollmien. Furthermore, Prandtl founded the Aerodynamische
                Versuchsanstalt (AVA) and the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für
                Strömungsforschung in Göttingen, nuclei for the growth of fluid
                mechanics in Germany. In this article I trace this development on
                the basis of my recent biography of Prandtl.},
